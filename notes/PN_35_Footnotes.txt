Incorporating load flexibility in the chemical processes
to improve the economics of integrating variable renewable energy.

Challenge of viable and feasible electrifition
>> Steady state demand of chemical industry
>> Excess RE provision ?? energy storage in the form of compressed H2 but with technical barriers
like cost, storage, safety

>> The intention of this work is to reveal the key mechanisms
by which process flexibility can potentially improve the economic
and environmental performances of chemical production powered by
variable renewable sources.
>> Implemented model for Germany and US > due to high availability of wind and solar power

Assumptions
(1) One year operation with no downtime of methanol production. 
(2) All process units are assumed to have a life of 30 years.
(3) Makeup streams in carbon capture process are excluded in costing
because the materials loss is negligible. 
(4) The energy from the purge stream is ignored since it is difficult to recover the heat from
process flare. 
(5) The compressors modelled in this work are assumed to be isentropic with an efficiency of 75%. (6) All mechanical work
and process heating (except the integrated heating) are powered by
electricity only. 
(7) The electrolysers can ramp instantaneously from 0–100%. 
(8) The storage units are not limited by charging or discharging
rate. 
(9) The standby losses of energy and material in the storage units
are neglected.

\--\Results\--\
 
\\The optimisation results are shown to be strongly affected by two
factors, i.e., the dispatchable energy price and the degree of process
flexibility\\
\\with relatively cheap renewable power, the benefits from a flexible
process would be limited.\\
\\inspection of the limited economic improvement by process
flexibility shows that the benefit is restricted by the level of renewable
penetration\\
\\The reliance of H2 storage is reduced because the variability of renewable sources
is tackled by the alternative subsystems, i.e.,CO2 and raw methanol
storage, which are much cheaper than H2 storage\\
\\If the renewable generation is relatively cheap, the excess provision
of renewable power may occur in lieu with renewable energy storage
(i.e., the H2-based ESS). The benefits of process flexibility in such a case
would be mainly from the reduction of the renewable over-provision\\

AND MOST ECONOMICAL PROCESS WITH AND WITHOUT FLEXIBLE PROCESSES

For viable flexibility implementation
//The cost of the core flexible chemical process units, i.e., those
that need to be over-sized to enable load adjustment, should not be a
dominant element in the total production cost, and (2) the storage cost
for intermediate products in the chemical process – incurred due to the
need for handling flexibility disparity between process units – should
be sufficiently lower than the energy storage system for VRE//

The demonstrated benefits of process flexibility arise from
reduced expensive energy (H2) storage (when the renewable generation
is expensive) and, in certain cases, improved energy utilisation due
to the reduction of curtailment and energy conversion losses (when
the renewable generation is cheap).
