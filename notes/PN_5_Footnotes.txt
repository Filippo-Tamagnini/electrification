Power to ammonia - The combined
application of water electrolysis and Haber-Bosch process is
called power-to-ammonia (P2A) technology.

Advantages
>> it provides renewable feedstock to fertilizer industry
>> it contributes significantly to system balancing over both time (energy storage) 
>> contributes to space (energy transfer).

- costs of P2A dominated by electrolysis : chemical based electrical energy storage
- large amounts of storage, flexibility in terms of design
- dual role as producers of synthetic fuels or chemicals
- In the power and heat sector P2A becomes competitive compared to fossil natural gas only if gas price
 or CO2 emission price rises
- 3 step model - electrolysis -> intermediate hydrogen buffer -> ammonia synthesis as opposed to conventional 2 step process of gas suuply -> ammonia synthesis

Electrolysis 
1. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) chosen for flexibility
2. Cost analysis done with predictions

Air separation 
- Cryogenic distillation as only commercialy viable tech
- Cost analysis done
\\ Advantages \\
\\ produce several gases at low incremental capital and energy cost.
\\ The process also has the advantage of being able to economically liquefy the
oxygen which is produced in the electrolysis plant, and store it for later use


>> Intermediate h-storage with compressors with cost estimates

>> Ammonia synthesis
- Hydrogen feed from intermediate storage as opposed to feed stream compression (ed) at STP and nitrogen at 8 bar ; lower energy requirement
- Exothermicity of reaction is exploited for direct heating

>> Ammonia storage with cost estimates
>> Solar PhotoVoltaic plants with cost estimates 
>> Heat integration is possible but is limited by the low operating temperature of PEM electrolysis

>> We see that P2A serves three roles in the results of this
study. Firstly it produces renewable ammonia for the fertilizer
industry; secondly it acts as energy vector to transfer energy in
time, i.e. acts as energy storage; thirdly it acts as energy vector
to transfer energy in space, i.e. acts as substitute for power
transmission.
