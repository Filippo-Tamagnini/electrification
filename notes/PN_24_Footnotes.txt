Two case studies possible designs of electrified heat supply for processing industries and to 
compare the characteristics of heat recovery networks and utility systems
under electrification with those under conventional fossil-fuel energy systems.
>> design interaction between heat recovery and electrification
>> cost-effectiveness of electrified energy systems and its dependence on heat recovery
