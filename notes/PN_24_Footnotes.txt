Two case studies possible designs of electrified heat supply for processing industries and to 
compare the characteristics of heat recovery networks and utility systems
under electrification with those under conventional fossil-fuel energy systems.
>> design interaction between heat recovery and electrification
>> cost-effectiveness of electrified energy systems and its dependence on heat recovery

Previous Case studies :
1.The use of hydrogen generated from electrolysis and the supply of electricity for
process heating are considered for the production of ammonia
2. electricity-assisted heating using heat pumps and CO2 hydrogenation using hydrogen from electrolysis are designed for
methanol production
3. evaluation of electrification options and applied it to an oxo synthesis plant, in which
a pinch analysis was utilized to compare the heating requirements between the conventional and electrified processes
 >> No systematic strategy for selection of electrification options
and supported the design of site-wide utility management under electrified processing.
4. The use of an electricity header, with which electricity supply and generation
from individual processes interact, is proposed to support site-wide
electricity distribution.

This paper - work investigated the simultaneous introduction of electrified heating options,
determining the most appropriate schemes for electrification >> TWO CASE STUDIES

Electrified heation
=> Ease of operation
=> Ease of process control >> Many degrees of freedom, fast dynamics, fast start up and shutdown
=> High energy efficiency >> the supply of electrified heat can be conducted in a more uniformly distributed manner
=> high resiliency and adaptiveness for non-steady and time-dependent operations
=> industrial-scale system implementation of electric heaters and electrode boilers is currently available for process
   industries >> the technology readiness level (TRL) is regarded as 9.

CASE STUDY 1 - production of methyl acetate via carbonylation of dimethyl ether
Two processes involved -
>> production of dimethyl ether through the dehydration of methanol - DEHYDRATION UNIT
>> production of methyl acetate by the reaction between carbon monoxide and dimethyl ether - REACTOR UNIT

Two levels of electrification realised -
>> Level 1 : Semi-electrification - replaces the conventional exchanger
with an electric heater.
>> Level 2 : Full electrification - complicated option > requires configurational changes 
1. Introduce a heat pump that provides the heat required for the process at the expense of the power.
2. Integrate the ORC with the heat available from the two reactors, in which heat used for steam production in the base
scenario is used as the energy source for electricity generation.
