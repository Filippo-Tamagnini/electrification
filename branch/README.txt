This is the repo for the material. 

Master file: 
master.xslx contains a table with several entries. You should use this to track the status of papers. Use the tags column to insert some tags, separated by commas, to make the search easier later on. If you download a pdf of the paper place it in the sources folder and write its name in the respective column of the master file.
If you have extensive notes about the paper(s), place them in the notes folder and write the filename in the respective column of the master file.
Use the status column to track the status of the corresponding paper (choose your preferred keywords for this).
The rest should be relatively straightforward. I have also left some space for additional table headers in case you need them.

Sources folder:
here you put the pdf of the papers you downloaded. Feel free to annotate them.

Notes folder:
in case you want to make more extensive notes about some papers, put them here as word or text documents.
Use the notes folder to collect notes about the work in general
